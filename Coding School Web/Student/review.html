 		<h3>James Park</h3>
		<p class="reviewContent">Looooooove this service!!! Makes my life sooo much easier being a small office with only one front desk staff using Jessi's Coding School has given me so much more time for the other thousand things I have on my plate. I love the when a patient cancels last minute that I have the option to send a text our to people that are due to try to fill it! We use that all the time! Also, I love that you can set up reminders for patients that left and did not schedule their restorative treatment!! Patients rave about the service! We absolutely love it! I have used a few other systems similar to this but this one does so much more than the "competition." Also, anytime I need help or have a question their customer service is impeccable! We use this with SoftDent and it has integrated wonderfully!</p>

 		<p class="reviewContent">We are new to the Jessi's Coding School family and it has been wonderful! Our patients love the save the date reminders, the easy one-touch confirmations, and ESPECIALLY the two hour prior to appointment notices. Our busy moms and dads tell us they really love this feature. Our staff loves the fast responses we get for confirmations as well! The staff at Jessi's Coding School has been so fast to respond to any and all of my questions and have made this a great asset to our office.</p>
